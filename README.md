## In order to defend and preserve the honour of the profession of computer programmers, I promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement that- 

- [x] I will not produce harmful code.
- [x] The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate. 
- [x] I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should. 
- [x] I will make frequent, small releases so that I do not impede the progress of others
- [x] I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
- [x] I will never stop learning and improving my craft.   
- [x] I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself and others as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases productivity.
